# OpenAPI Endpoint Coverage Baseline

Generated by `npm run openapi-coverage:generate`. Do not edit manually.

Scope:
- Implemented endpoint signatures from literal Express `app.<method>(...)`, `router.<method>(...)`, and `.route(...).<method>(...)` registrations.
- Router registrations are expanded through `app.use("/prefix", router)` mounts declared in `backend/src/index.ts`.
- Documented endpoint signatures from backend JSDoc blocks tagged `@openapi` or `@swagger`.
- Path normalization aligns Express `:id` and OpenAPI `{id}` parameters.
