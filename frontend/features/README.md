# Frontend Features

Start-here index for domain modules under `frontend/features`.

## Start Here

1. Route entrypoints: `frontend/app/**/page.tsx` and `docs/ROUTE_MAP.md`.
2. Feature ownership map: `docs/FEATURE_INDEX.json`.
3. Targeted regression commands: `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`.

## Feature Domains

| Directory | Domain README | Primary App Routes |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Update Rule

- Whenever feature behavior changes materially, update or verify this index and the affected `frontend/features/*/README.md` file in the same change set.
